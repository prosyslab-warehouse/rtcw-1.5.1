  The "original" tarball is based on a git export, edited to leave out
  non-free tools, third-party libraries etc. as described by the
  get-orig-source target in debian/rules; you can use
  'make -f debian/rules get-orig-source' to repeat this process.
  .
  Some of the omitted libraries are DFSG-free themselves, but since we need
  to repack the tarball anyway, omitting them too means we don't need to
  comply with as many licenses.

License: GPL-3+-with-idsoft-extra-terms
 There are two very similar license grants for code originating
 from the single-player or multiplayer engine, which are grouped
 together as one license for the purposes of this copyright file.
 The "additional terms" are among those allowed by the GPL version 3,
 section 7; they are the same as in the Doom 3 source code on which
 dhewm3 and rbdoom3bfg are based.
 .
 You can find the GPL license text on a Debian system under
 /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3.
 .
 ==== License grant ===================================================

 [This is the single player version. The multiplayer version is
 identical, except for the replacement of "single player" and "SP"
 with "multiplayer" and "MP".]
 .

 GPL Source Code (‘RTCW SP Source Code’).
